				<h1>Hi There!</h1>
				<p> 
					<span style="font-weight: bold">
					I am a Bournemouth based programmer. I mostly use Java but I also know Python, Javascript and C. I also do a bit of web development. This is my website where I regularly upload my most recent projects and ideas. My other passions are music and maths, which I will try and write about in future on this site.

					In 2012 I recieved my first computer for christmas: a raspberry pi. I used it to teach myself python and begun what would become a long standing passion for computing. I used to love writing problems to solve maths problems and for testing ideas I had. During this time I would not start using GUIS for a long time - I almost stuck exclusively to using the console. However about a year later I would start learning the language that would become my favourite to this day.
					<br>
					<br>
					Java was the language that exposed me to proper application development. Initially I just made console based commands (for the first year or so of learning) but I eventually moved on to basic graphics with swing. Although graphic design is not my forte, I really enjoyed the challenge and made a few generative art projects and small applications in this manor. Eventually, however, I moved onto JavaFX which is vastly superior for UI design. With JavaFX I have been able to make many programs to solve a wide array of problems. From Sorting Algorithms to the Towers of Hanoi I have found JavaFX to be the perfect tool for application design.
