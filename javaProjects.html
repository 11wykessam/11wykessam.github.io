				<h1> Random Generation Word Art </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/wordgenIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						This was my first every attempt at a graphical project in java. If I were to do it again I would structure the project almost entirely differenty. For a start confining everything to one text file made the code tricky to read and almost impossible to trace errors. It would have been infinitely more suitable to have individual classes for different aspects of the program e.g the menu, canvas and circles. However I am proud of what this project stands for: it represents a shift away from small maths programs in a console to something I can show to people. I remember distinctly being extremely proud when I finished this. The art generated is also very special to me. In the program each letter has a unique shape within the program, with each circle being of random size and colour. This means that whilst the same string input will return the same general shape. The colours and sizes of the circles will be different each time. All the images sampled on this site have been generated from words that are very special to me - names of family, my hobbies and secrets. It represents a way for me to share my life publicly without actually telling anyone any specifics about me. From then, I like to think I've grown as a programmer and looking back on this early project made me happy and nostalgic.

				<h1> Modular Arithmetic Circle Art </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/circlegenIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						This is one of my earliest graphical java projects. Before I learnt JavaFX and before I even knew how to properly write object orientated code (this is mainly characterised by 14 year old me's bizarre decision to put almost all of the code into one text file). Nevertheless the principles that this project stood for still remain very dear to me. The idea of beauty behind the most mundane mathematics and finding complex patterns within simple bits of maths. This project works on the principle that every number is connected by a line to itself times the number inputted into the times table box then modulo the number in the divisions box. This simple bit of maths can create some extraordinary, from cardioids set to squares. I was heavily inspired for this project by the youtube channel Mathologer. The basic idea is illustrated in this <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8"> video </a>.

				<h1> Calculator </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class ="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/calculatorIMG.png"></div>
					<p>

					One of my first projects with JavaFX, I really enjoyed the more design and CSS based parts of this project as it gave me an opportunity to apply some things I've learnt in web development to software development.

				<h1> Noughts And Crosses </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/noughtsandcrossesIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						For my second JavaFX project I decided to make a simple game. Something that I could test graphics on and also have a go at writing a simple AI for. Unfortunately the AI is quite easy to trick as it only looks 2 moves into the future, however for a first attempt I'd say this was relatively succesful.

				<h1> Connect 4 </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/connect4IMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						After finishing the Noughts and Crosses Project, I decided I would try and up the complexity of my projects. This new project would be slightly harder than noughts and crosses and would give me greater room for experimentation with the way I use CSS and markup.

				<h1> Password Vault </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/passwordvaultIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						Whilst the cryptography used within this project isn't really up to modern standards, with the password hash being SHA-256 without a salt and the two way password encryption using DES. This project was more an opportunity for me to experiment with file handling and creating my own data structures. I found it quite challenging as the project was significantly larger in the amount of code needed than a lot of other projects I have done and this made organising everything and keeping the code neat more difficult.

				<h1> Sorting Algorithms (WIP) </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/sortIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						This project started as a way for me to revise part of my decision maths for my AS exams. It was very interesting to me as visual representations of data and algorithms have always been very charming to me. Eventually I plan to code bubble sort, quick sort and bogosort (for a laugh).

				<h1> Data Structure Library </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<p>	
						This library is a collection of simple data structure classes that I, or anyone else, can use in future projects. This project started as another revision idea and has been helpful for me to remember the role and function of different data structures. Current data structures included are: Circular Queues, Linked Lists, Stacks and Binary Trees.

				<h1> Towers Of Hanoi </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/towersIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						I decided to do this project to practice animation. Primarily trying to use a queue to implement animation. Each sprite has a queue of versions of itself, it will change to the next sprite every frame at a rate of 60 per second. This was also a good exercise in object orientation as I was able to create subclasses for the pins and have all things on the screen as being part of the superclass Sprite. Then to animate I could just implement a tick and render method in Sprite and iterate through the entire Sprite list ticking and rendering 60 times a second per sprite. Overall I think this was quite succesful and the code I have created will form the basis for a new project I am making.

				<h1> Logic Circuit Simulator </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<div class="imageContainer"><img src="res/imgs/LogicSimulatorIMG.png"></div>
					<p>
						This is my most ambitious project so far and has been my pet project for the last few months. It is an amalgamation of everything that I have learned so far from programming. The premise is a simple circuit diagram drawer and simulator similar to Yenka however it is more simplified and deals only with logic diagrams. I found the limitations of Yenka's small canvas quite annoying so my solution has an infinite canvas, the way in which you can draw wires is also much less limited than Yenka with the option of snapping and horizontal/vertical wires. Current features include drawing, simulating and saving circuits and I'm planning on adding an eraser tool for easier removal of components and more components in future. I've learned loads from the development of this project including saving objects more easily, more about polymorphism and how to manage more complicated data structures. All skills I look forward to developing in future.
