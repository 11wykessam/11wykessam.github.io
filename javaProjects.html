				<h1> Calculator </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class ="projectContainer">
					<img src="res/imgs/calculatorIMG.png">
					<p>

					One of my first projects with JavaFX, I really enjoyed the more design and CSS based parts of this project as it gave me an opportunity to apply some things I've learnt in web development to software development.

				<h1> Noughts And Crosses </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<img src="res/imgs/noughtsandcrossesIMG.png">
					<p>
						For my second JavaFX project I decided to make a simple game. Something that I could test graphics on and also have a go at writing a simple AI for. Unfortunately the AI is quite easy to trick as it only looks 2 moves into the future, however for a first attempt I'd say this was relatively succesful.

				<h1> Connect 4 </h1>

				<div class="projectContainer">
					<img src="res/imgs/connect4IMG.png">
					<p>
						After finishing the Noughts and Crosses Project, I decided I would try and up the complexity of my projects. This new project would be slightly harder than noughts and crosses and would give me greater room for experimentation with the way I use CSS and markup.

				<h1> Password Vault </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<img src="res/imgs/passwordvaultIMG.png">
					<p>
						Whilst the cryptography used within this project isn't really up to modern standards, with the password hash being SHA-256 without a salt and the two way password encryption using DES. This project was more an opportunity for me to experiment with file handling and creating my own data structures. I found it quite challenging as the project was significantly larger in the amount of code needed than a lot of other projects I have done and this made organising everything and keeping the code neat more difficult.

				<h1> Sorting Algorithms (WIP) </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<img src="res/imgs/sortIMG.png">
					<p>
						This project started as a way for me to revise part of my decision maths for my AS exams. It was very interesting to me as visual representations of data and algorithms have always been very charming to me. Eventually I plan to code bubble sort, quick sort and bogosort (for a laugh).

				<h1> Data Structure Library </h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="projectContainer">
					<p>	
						This library is a collection of simple data structure classes that I, or anyone else, can use in future projects. This project started as another revision idea and has been helpful for me to remember the role and function of different data structures. Current data structures included are: Circular Queues, Linked Lists and Stacks.
